Project Xenix
==============

A Microsoft Kinect (Audio API) project that allows the user to use natural speech to control music from iTunes,
ask for weather and time

**NOTE:** Since it was created using the BETA Kinect SDK in June 2011, it will not work with the latest SDK as Microsoft changed
many of the function calls.  I will update this app when I have the time!
